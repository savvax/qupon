## Goal
Task 1537 (design pre-flight) found mechanical UI defects; fix your slice so every screen looks finished in en/ru/kk at 1440 and 390.

## Read first
- `reports/design/preflight/mechanical.md` — the defect table (task 1537 pre-flight, mechanical part). Each row has the
  route, locale/width, the defect, the likely source file and a suggested fix. The screenshots it refers to are in
  `reports/design/preflight/before/` (`<route-slug>-<locale>-<width>.jpg`, index in `index.md`).
- `docs/design/language.md` (tokens, spacing, type) — fixes must use the design system, not one-off styles.
- `apps/web/e2e/sweep.spec.ts` (task 91539: `SWEEP_OUT=<dir>` writes shots; routes, locales en/ru/kk, widths 1440/390).

## Do
- Fix rows 1, 5, 6, 14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 31 of mechanical.md (public pages: /invite, /proof picker, /sandbox (kk dev-issue badge on fx-bank — find and
  fix the runtime error or missing kk key), landing, footer/network chip, /holder, /bonds, /proof/<mint>).
- Fix the root cause in the shared component when several rows share it; do not patch per page.
- Strings: en/ru/kk must stay in strict key parity (messages.test); kk is the longest — test it at 390.
- Re-shoot only the routes you touched: `SWEEP_OUT=reports/design/preflight/after` with the sweep filtered to those routes
  (add a `SWEEP_ROUTES` env filter to sweep.spec.ts if it does not exist yet — comma-separated route list), commit the shots.
- Append to `reports/design/preflight/fixes.md` one line per row you fixed: `#<row> <route> — <what changed> (<file>)`.

## Acceptance
Every listed row fixed (or explained in fixes.md why not); `sweep.spec.ts` green in mock mode; after-shots committed; `make verify` green.
Commit `fix(web): design pre-flight — public pages` (`task: 91545`).

## Finish
Write `reports/worklog/91545.md` (3–6 lines), commit with `task: 91545`, print `DONE:91545` or `BLOCKED:91545 <reason>`.
